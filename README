Tk/FilterEntry version 0.01
===========================

    Tk::FilterEntry - An entry with filter

    This widget is derived from Tk::Entry and it implements an other way of
    validation. The input is validate by a callback or more simply by a
    filter, when the entry leaves the focus. And if is invalid, the
    foreground color is changed.

    So, this widget deals well with textVariable.
